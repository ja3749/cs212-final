# CS-212 final website: Task management web application

## Problem statement
People often struggle to keep track of their tasks and to-dos. A simple task management application can help users organize, prioritize, and track their tasks efficiently.

## Project components
**CRUD functionality**: This website implements the **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** functionality, enabling users to create, edit, update, and delete tasks!

**Marking tasks as completed**: Allows users to mark tasks as completed. There is a visual distinction between completed and pending tasks.

**Searching tasks**: Search functionality is implemented to allow users to quickly find tasks based on keywords.

**Sorting tasks**: Pending tasks can be sorted by due date and priority level.
